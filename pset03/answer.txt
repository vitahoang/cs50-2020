sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?:
- I use "time" command to benchmark the program
- This program has the longest runtime as "0m7.597s"
- So does the bubble sort with the runtime of O(n^2)

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:
- I use "time" command to benchmark the program
- This program has the shortest runtime as "0m0.682s"
- So does the merge sort with the runtime of O(n log n)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?:
- I use "time" command to benchmark the program
- This program has the runtime as "0m3.234s", about half of the sort1's runtime
- It's similar to the runtime of the selection sort, which is O(n^2/2)
